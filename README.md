# C-interpreter
An interpreter for C language.

Idea behind the project:
As a C programmer, whenever I had to test some C code I would generally open a new file 
write the code and then compile. When the test cases were bigger, its ok.
But for smaller things like checking what a method does or what could be the output
for a specific input, I thought its better to have an interpreter that 
	1. examines each and every line as you enter it.
	2. reports back in case something went wrong.
	3. produce the output if everything is OK.

Analogus to this can be considered, an HTML test play ground where you can enter basic html
and press the go button to check its output, without bothering about the html file to be generated
or loading the page in the browser.

All you have got to do is write code.
