Input:
The interpreter only understands two kinds of inputs: native commands or C code.
Anything other than the native commands is considered to be C code and dealt accordingly.

Native Commands:

"hold"
	Do not print the output as soon as a "printf" is encountered, instead wait for the run command.
	Default is "unhold".

"hold-" DEFAULT; pronounced as "hold minus"
	Do not print the output as soon as a "printf" is encountered, instead wait for the run command.

"new"	 
	Starts a new context. The old context is flushed, i.e. all declarations and statements are removed.
	The user is always provided with a new context the interpreter is started. If in case the user wants a
	new context while the interpreter is running, then "new" command can be used.

"run"
	Run you program at any point of time.
	Whether the interpreter is on "hold" or "hold-", you can always use this command to see the output of the
	latest code.

"exit"|"close"|"quit"
	Any one of these commands can be used to close the interpreter.
